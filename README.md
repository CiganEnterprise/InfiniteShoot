# InfiniteShoot

This webapp represents the concept of a business focused on photo shooting and creating albums for different
events such as graduation, marriage or birthday parties. The webapp is well automated with lots of subsystems
such as authentication, album builder or personal gallery view.

## Backend

In the backend I have 9 databases each of them very important for the functionality and infrastructure of 
the app.
