# InfiniteShoot

This webapp represents the concept of a business focused on photo shooting and creating albums for different
events such as graduation, marriage or birthday parties. The webapp is well automated with lots of subsystems
such as authentication, album builder or personal gallery view.

the app.

* AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION which includes the login system and users table
* BLOG which contains one table, Posts
* CONTACT which includes two tables: Contacts and Newsletters
